## [About Me](#about)

Hello, my name is **Jwan**, and I'm a passionate junior cybersecurity. My journey into the world of technology began in Syria, where the release of the iPhone 4 was a rare and fascinating event. As I dived into the world of jailbreaking and roaming Android phones, I discovered the magic of software customization and development.

Growing up in a rapidly changing digital landscape, I quickly realized the importance of cybersecurity in our daily lives. The potential for cyber attacks, data breaches, and network disruptions became increasingly clear to me. I knew that in order to protect individuals, businesses, and critical infrastructure, I needed to develop a deep understanding of the latest security threats and how to mitigate them.

This realization fueled my decision to pursue a career in cybersecurity. I set out to equip myself with the necessary skills and certifications, earning CompTIA's **A+**, **Network+**, **Security+**, **CySA+**, and **PenTest+** credentials. With this solid foundation, I've been able to dive into a range of cybersecurity projects, showcasing my expertise and passion for safeguarding the digital realm.
